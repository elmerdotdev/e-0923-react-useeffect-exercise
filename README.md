# React Exercise - useEffect

## Guidelines

- Create a 'dev' branch on GitHub and then clone the repository
- Use *git switch dev* to switch to the dev branch
- Install React with Vite and name the app "react-useeffect". Make sure to use **cd react-useeffect** to change directory
- Once you're done with the exercise, push your changes to dev branch and create a pull request to master
- Merge your pull request after adding me as a Reviewer

## Instructions

1. Choose any API that you like
2. Using a useEffect hook, fetch the data and store it into a state
3. Pass the data array as a prop for a separate component called 'List.tsx'
4. On the List component, use *map* to output the data in a list
5. Pass each individual item as a prop to a separate child component called 'ListItem.tsx'
