# React Exercise - useEffect

## Guidelines

- Create a 'dev' branch on GitHub and then clone the repository
- Use *git switch dev* to switch to the dev branch
- Install React with Vite and make sure to use **cd foldername** to change directory
- Once done, push your changes to dev branch and create a pull request to master
- Merge your pull request after adding me as a Reviewer

## Instructions

1. Choose any API that you like
2. Using a useEffect hook, fetch the data and store it into a state
3. Pass the data as a prop for a separate component called 'List.tsx'
4. On the List component, use *map* to output the data in a list
